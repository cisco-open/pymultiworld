# Broadcast

This file provides an example of collective communication using broadcast across single and multiple worlds. This exaplme will perform broadcast 100 times with a different source on each step, in a range from 0 to 2, based on the world size.

`--worldinfo` argument is composed by the world index(1, 2) and the rank in that world (0, 1 or 2).

## Running the Script in a Single World

The single world example can be executed by opening 3 separate terminal windows to have 3 different processes and running the following commands in each terminal window:

```bash
# on terminal window 1 - will initialize 2 worlds (world1 and world2) with rank 0
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,0 --worldinfo 2,0
# on terminal window 2 - will initialize world1 with rank 1
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,1
# on terminal window 3 - will initialize world1 with rank 2
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,2
```

## Running the Script in Multiple Worlds

The multiple world examplecan be executed by opening 5 separate terminal windows to have 5 different processes and running the following commands in each terminal window:

```bash
# on terminal window 1 - will initialize 2 worlds (world1 and world2) with rank 0
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,0 --worldinfo 2,0
# on terminal window 2 - will initialize world1 with rank 1
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,1
# on terminal window 3 - will initialize world1 with rank 2
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,2
# on terminal window 4 - will initialize world2 with rank 1
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 2,1
# on terminal window 5 - will initialize world2 with rank 2
python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 2,2
```

To run processes on different hosts, `--addr` arugment can be used witn host's IP address. (`python m8d.py --backend nccl --worldinfo 1,0 --worldinfo 2,0 --addr 10.20.1.50`)
